The current project named as Final Degree Project (TFG), follows the development and
implementation of a mechanical control system based on multiple sensors and a given
password, using wireless and wire connection. This system consists of an user interface
(UI), a microcontroller, a wireless communication protocol and a set of sensors and
actuators.
Through an intuitive user interface, the user has the ability to set light and temperature
thresholds, whose values are captured by the microcontroller. When the light and
temperature levels fall below the set thresholds, the user can be authenticated by a
password to access the control of a mechanic system. The communication between the user
interface and the microcontroller is done wirelessly, ensuring a cable-free connection.
The main objective of this project is to provide a pedagogic experience to students who are
taking their first steps in the field of electronics during their secondary education. The project
seeks to provide them with the opportunity to analyze and explore a project that incorporates
and implements professional elements, which resembles what they do at this educational
level, but in this case, using simpler discrete components and requiring minimal
programming skills.
